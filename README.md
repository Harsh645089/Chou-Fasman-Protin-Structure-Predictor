# Chou-Fasman-Protin-Structure-Predictor
A Python-based implementation of the classical Chou–Fasman method for protein secondary structure prediction. The project uses sliding-window analysis to identify α-helix and β-strand nucleation regions and applies rule-based conflict resolution using amino acid propensities.
